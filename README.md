My Final Project for COGS 18 Fall 2018 at the University of California, San Diego.

This project is a chatbot that can be used as a calculator or an encoder / decoder. The program can add, subtract, multiply, divide, find the remainder, or raise to a power. In addition, the encoder can take any input string and encode it, which the user can decode by copying into the decode function.
